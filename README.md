# Crowd Dictation (Detection) MVP

Track how crowded your shop, cafÃ©, or public space is using a simple webcam and AI. This project uses a webcam to detect and count people in real-time, providing a live graph of crowd frequency over time.

## MVP Overview

This is the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for a real-time **Crowd Detection System** using:
- YOLOv8 (for person detection)
- OpenCV (for webcam + display)
- Matplotlib (for graph plotting)

You can later convert this into a full dashboard with alerts, database logging, or even deploy on edge devices like Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.
